1. Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? Maintaining a professional enviorment is a way to keep yourself and others around going in the direction that you all want to go.  It is a way to keep work relationships good in a productive way.
2. How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?  I will always maintain a professional aura about myself, because it shows that I not only respect my self or our clients, but I also respect and value my team and the compnay that I work for.
3. How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had? I have always been taught to have a professional attitude at work.  It shows respect for all parties especially yourself.  I found that being professional will protect you as you advance in your career.
4. Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before? I taught a fellow student in another class about being professional in the workplace.  I told him that it is a way to get the things done that need to be done while maintaining the relationships at work with good qualities.
5. If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel?  While the savior never really worked in an office setting, he represented himself and the father in a way that I would consider very professional.  They had a task they wanted done and they did everything in their power to get it done, while being there to help others along the way.  The savior especially, because he was the perfect leader as well as the perfect follower.
