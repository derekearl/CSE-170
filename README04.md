Week 04 Reflection Technical Teamwork                                                                  100 pts
1. Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20pts)  I would say one needs to have discipline is one of the most important things when working in a team.  One should have self awareness in ones doings always and should give 100 percent effort in all things that the group does.
2. How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks? (20 pts.)  I will always have self discipline when working on a team and be sure to learn something new from my teams perspective so that I can not only appply myself but I can also leave better than I came in.
3. How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had? (20 pts.)  I have always tried to give 110 percent effort in all things that I do.  I have had experiences before where I did not fully apply myself and I suffered because of it.  I learned that even if you are super talented in something you should still give 100 percent effort in learning to be a better thing in what it is you are going into.
4. Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before? (20 pts.)  I taught my wife about having the discipline in everthing that you do because it reflects who you are as a person.  It also shows how great of a disciple of Jesus Christ you are, because you are building off the talents that Heavenly Father has blessed you with.
5. If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20pts.)  Showing the lord that you are willing to expand on the talents that you are blessed with in a way shows how grateful you are for the blessings that you have.
