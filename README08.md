Derek Earl Week 08 Reflection Technical Teamwork     100 pts.
1. Why is this week's topic important for teamwork (20pts)?  There will always be some sort of conflict in the workplace, and resolving the conflict is crucial to maintaining a good work enviorment.
2. How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks (20 pts)?  I will never let my pride get the best of me when I am in conflict with someone I will never belittle them and be sure to apologize when I make an error and always be teachable.
3. How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had (20 pts)?  I have been in workplaces before where I have had some bad conflict between co workers or I have seen it with others and it made work terrible but when there is good or no conflict everything runs smooth and it makes work fun!
4. Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn, that they didn’t know before (20 pts)?  I talked with my wife about work conflict how there is good conflict that makes you learn from your mistake and help others from making the same mistake.
5. If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel (20 pts)?  The lord always taught us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves, so when we treat each others the way we want to be treated we can be taught and also reslove any bad conflict that may come our way.
